#' Assign observations to folds of as equal size as possible
#'
#' Observation i goes to fold ((i - 1) mod V) + 1, so within a stratum the
#' folds interleave by row order: 1, 2, ..., V, 1, 2, ... This is exactly what
#' \code{cvTools::cvFolds(n, K = V, type = "random")$which} returned, which
#' create_cv_folds() used to read: \code{$which} is the fold of the
#' \emph{permuted} observation, \code{rep(seq_len(K), length.out = n)}, and
#' the permutation itself is in \code{$subsets}, which was never read. So the
#' assignment has always been deterministic, whatever the seed.
#'
#' It is kept that way here on purpose. Drawing the folds at random
#' (\code{rep_len(seq_len(V), n)[sample.int(n)]}) changes the training sets
#' every adjustment step sees, and on the mlbench BreastCancer data that
#' exposed a case where \code{hopach::hopach(mss = "mean")} in
#' reduce_dimensions() never returns. Randomizing the folds therefore needs a
#' guard around HOPACH first, and is a change in its own right rather than
#' part of dropping the cvTools dependency.
#'
#' The unused permutation still consumed n random numbers, and everything
#' downstream that draws from the RNG (SuperLearner's own cross-validation
#' folds, the per-variable future seeds) continues from where it left off. So
#' the same draw is made and discarded here, and a fit from a given seed is
#' identical to one from the previous version. Drop it when the folds become
#' random, since results change then anyway.
#'
#' @param n Number of observations.
#' @param V Number of folds.
#'
#' @return Integer vector of length \code{n} with the fold of each observation.
#'   Fold sizes differ by at most one; when \code{n < V} some folds get no
#'   observation.

#' Assign whole groups (clusters) to folds

#' Groups are shuffled, then placed largest first into the fold that currently
#' has the fewest observations, which keeps fold sizes close. For a binary
#' outcome, groups containing events are placed first, each into the fold with
#' the fewest events so far, so events are spread across folds as evenly as
